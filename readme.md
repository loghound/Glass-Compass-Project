### Compass for Google Glass

I took a smple project and **ported** it to glass - I use the word ported loosly however,

This also runs on a regular android phone

Not terribly useful... Mostly using to do some glass development

**Important** Developed with Android Studio -- If you use eclipse you need to sort it out
